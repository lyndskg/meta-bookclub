## Introduction

__*meta-bookclub*__ is an AI-powered book and poem recommendation system that leverages Machine Learning to generate personalized lists of suggested reading materials to users based on their Goodreads and Kindle accounts, as well as their specific reading history and metrics.

Leveraging the power of machine learning, the system will analyze the user's reading history, including books and poems they've read, their ratings, and their to-read list, along with additional user-provided preferences, to generate a curated list of suggested reading materials across various genres.

It'll scour the internet for recommendations to fine-tune its profile of you &mdash; the 20th century classics lover, the Kaia Gerber book club fanatic, the Pablo Neruda romantic. 

&nbsp;

## Objectives
The main objective of __*meta-bookclub*__ is to enhance the reading experience of users by suggesting relevant books and poems that align with their unique interests and preferences. 

The system will continuously learn from user interactions and feedback, allowing it to improve and fine-tune its recommendations over time.
