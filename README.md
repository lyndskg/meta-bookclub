## Introduction

__*meta-bookclub*__ is an innovative coding project that aims to provide personalized book and poem recommendations to users based on their historical reading data from Goodreads/Kindle accounts and user-inputted preferences. It'll scour the internet for recommendations to fine-tune its profile of you &mdash; the 20th century classics lover, the Kaia Gerber book club fanatic, the Pablo Neruda romantic. 



Leveraging the power of machine learning, the system will analyze a user's reading history, including books and poems they've read, their ratings, and their to-read list, along with additional user-provided preferences, to generate a curated list of suggested reading materials across various genres.

&nbsp;

## Objectives
The main objective of __*meta-bookclub*__ is to enhance the reading experience of users by suggesting relevant books and poems that align with their unique interests and preferences. 

The system will continuously learn from user interactions and feedback, allowing it to improve and fine-tune its recommendations over time.

## Basic Workflow
<a name="BasicWorkflow"></a>
1. <ins>**Data Collection</ins>:**
      - Obtain user consent and access to their Goodreads/Kindle account(s) using the platform's APIs.
      - Retrieve the user's reading history, including books, poems, ratings, and to-read list.
      - Gather user-inputted preferences, such as favorite genre, book, author, and quotes.

2. <ins>**Data Preprocessing</ins>:**
      - Clean and preprocess the acquired data, handling missing information and converting it into a usable format.

3. <ins>**Feature Engineering</ins>:**
      - Extract relevant features from the data, such as book genres, author information, and user preferences.
      - Create embeddings or representations for books, poems, and user preferences to facilitate ML modeling.

4. <ins>**Machine Learning Model</ins>:**
   - Train a machine learning model (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches) to learn user preferences and generate book and poem recommendations.

5. <ins>**Fine-Tuning Option</ins>:**
   - Implement a user interface to allow users to adjust preference metrics' correlation with book/poem recommendations.
   - Collect user feedback on suggested readings to fine-tune the recommendation model accordingly.

6. <ins>**User Interface</ins>:**
   - Develop a web-based user interface using Flask or Django to interact with the recommendation system.
   - Allow users to view their suggested reading list, update preferences, and rate recommended books and poems.
